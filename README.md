# Neovim Config

Used [LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/starter) starter and followed the
LazyVim [Documentation](https://www.lazyvim.org/installation)

Here are my paths on Windows:

* Windows nvim path
  * `$HOME/AppData/Local/nvim`
* Windows nvim data path
  * `$HOME/AppData/Local/nvim-data`

## Installed

* [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md)
version 0.10.0 (A version > 0.9.0 is viable.)
* [NerdFont](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts?tab=readme-ov-file#font-installation)
* [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

### Issues

Ran into some issues when running in pop_os, and I will be looking to resolve
the issues in the coming year.

I will also be looking to optimize the nvim start up, though it is not bad
I want to make sure it is in an optimal state.

### Languages in setup
